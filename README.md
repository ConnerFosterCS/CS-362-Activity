How to run files: This code was made in the repl.it shell found here (https://repl.it/languages/python3) If you have an account and login the code can be directly uploaded to be ran through the repl.it IDE. If you do nat have an account and do not wish to make one, the terminal linked above is their accountless version but the code will have to be copy/pasted into it instead.
